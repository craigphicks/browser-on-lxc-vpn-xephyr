# browser-on-lxc-vpn-xephyr

Javascript module to create (from virgin generic ub18 lxc) a turnkey linux container (on the host) running firefox, vpn, and the X-server Xephyr.

# Requirements

Tested on host running Ubuntu 18.04.  
Requires ufw to be running on the host.
You should have already set up VPN (e.g. on a rented VPS)
and placed the client key in a file on the host: 
`/home/$USER/ffvpn-client.ovpn`.

# Usage

  node index.js init
     -intialiize container
  node index.js browse
    - restart a stopped container and start browser
    - NOTE: program will not exit until Xephyr and the browser are closed.
      (In no-Xephyr mode, until the browser is closed).
      You may run in background "node index.js browse &" to free up terminal.
      
# Parameters

Hard coded at top of index.js
To run without Xephyr, change `XServerXephyr` to  `false`.
The default screen size is 
```
const SCREENSIZE = '1920x1200'
```
so adjust as necessary.
Otherwise, not necessary to change.

- Publish on NPM.
